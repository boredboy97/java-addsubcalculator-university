		 * 		   - Declare scanner variable for user input

		 * Step 4: Check user input for operation selection:
		 * 		   - Use an inner do-while loop to validate user's selection of operation. 
		 * 		   - If user inputs anything other than 1 or 2, print error message and prompt user again.

		 * 		   There will be two cases: Addition and subtraction. Operations are described in step 6

		 * Step 8: For loops within each switch case to perform operations
		 * 		   Number of iterations will equal count variable that user inputs
		 * 		   - Case 1 (Addition):
		 * 			 - For each iteration, store next input as a double then add it to the addition variable
		 * 			 - Display addition output
		 * 		   - Case 2 (Subtraction):
		 * 			 - For each iteration, starting from second number, store as a double
		 * 			 - Sum these subsequent numbers as a sum to subtract from first number
		 * 			 - Subtract sum of numbers from first number	
		 * 			 - Display subtraction output
